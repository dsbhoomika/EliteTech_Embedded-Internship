# Task 2 – Home Automation with Bluetooth

## Objective
Design a simple embedded system to control electrical appliances wirelessly using Bluetooth and Arduino.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- 5V Relay Module
- LED / Bulb
- 220Ω Resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
When a command is sent from a mobile phone via Bluetooth, the HC-05 module receives the data and forwards it to the Arduino. The microcontroller reads the command and activates or deactivates the relay accordingly. If the ON command is received, the device turns ON. If the OFF command is received, the device turns OFF.

## Simulation Platform
Tinkercad Circuits
