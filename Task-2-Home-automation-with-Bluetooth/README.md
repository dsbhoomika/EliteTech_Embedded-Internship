Task 2 – Home Automation with Bluetooth
Objective

Design a Bluetooth-controlled embedded system to switch electrical devices ON and OFF using Arduino and a mobile phone.

Components Used

Arduino UNO

HC-05 Bluetooth Module

5V Relay Module

LED / Bulb

220Ω Resistor

Breadboard

Jumper Wires

Working Principle

When the user sends a command from the mobile phone through Bluetooth, the HC-05 module receives the signal and transfers it to the Arduino. The Arduino processes the command and controls the relay accordingly. If the ON command is received, the device turns ON. If the OFF command is received, the device turns OFF.
